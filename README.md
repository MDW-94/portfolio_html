### Basic Ideas So Far

- p5.js background that's responsive to scroll
- contents are clear and well designed - responsive for different screen sizes (design on small mobile with high throttling)
- Including links to projects with images that do not affect performance

### Resource

- https://api.jquery.com/resize/ - use for resizing p5.js?


### Further Thoughts

- Tried importing HTML files into the main, index.html however it seems this might not be supported on all types of browser at the present moment
